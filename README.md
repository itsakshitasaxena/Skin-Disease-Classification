## SkinVision: Intelligent Skin Disease Classification & Diagnosis Assistant

SkinVision is a deep learningâ€“based web application built to classify various human skin diseases from user-uploaded images. The system not only predicts the disease class using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but also recommends specialized doctors, collects user feedback, and offers an admin dashboard for data control.

# Objectives
- Automated Skin Disease Classification
- Early Diagnosis & Preventive Care
